SDKP–SD&N Quantum Oracle Frameworks and Vibrational Resonance Models
Author: Donald Paul Smith (aka FatherTime)

This repository contains the implementation and theoretical foundations of the SDKP (Size–Density–Kinetic Principle) and SD&N (Shape–Dimension–Number) frameworks, foundational to a novel approach to quantum search, entanglement modeling, and continuous optimization in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Key features include:
	•	Quantum Oracle Construction: Implementations of internal quantum oracles based on vibrational identity codes (7164, 1647, 4716, 6471) used for encoding resonance roles (Source, Receiver, Initiator, Reflector) in continuous quantum search problems.
	•	SDKP Time-Dynamic Framework: A non-Einsteinian space–time model leveraging Earth Orbital Speed (EOS) to replace the speed of light constant, modeling time evolution via size, density, kinetic energy, and velocity.
	•	SD&N Resonance Numerology: Mathematical structures describing entanglement fidelity oscillations and vibrational collapse/revival dynamics, governed by harmonic attractors at multiples of 6 and 7.
	•	Vibrational Entanglement Index (VEI): Quantitative measures for entanglement fidelity and decoherence incorporating quantum-computerization consciousness (QCC) effects.
	•	Kapnack Solver: An entropy-driven collapse algorithm designed to simplify NP-complete problems through vibrational resonance and continuous entropic convergence.
	•	Comprehensive Simulation Modules: Tools for simulating entanglement genesis, oracle query complexity, and resonance-based quantum search with detailed event logging and dynamic parameter control.

This work bridges theoretical physics, quantum computing, and advanced mathematical modeling, offering a unique framework for continuous quantum search algorithms with provable speedups and novel entanglement metrics. The repository serves as both a research platform and a base for NFT-backed scientific artifacts secured with blockchain timestamping.# Donald-Paul-Smith-FatherTime-SDKP-SD-N-Quantum-entanglement-
